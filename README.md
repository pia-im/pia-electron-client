## Pia Electron frontend

This is the source code repository for the [Pia](https://pia.im) desktop client.
For more information about Pia and what a Pia client is, see the [documentation](https://docs.pia.im) section [How Pia works](https://docs.pia.im/develop/how-pia-works).

This client does audio input, wake word detection, silence detection, and audio output. The audio input is sent to Pia via WebSockets, and the audio output is received from there. Speech detection, processing and speech generation all happens in Pia.

This simulates a smart speaker. It is intended mostly for developers and testers.

### Developer Installation

If you would like to install and run from the source files, see [INSTALL](INSTALL.md).
